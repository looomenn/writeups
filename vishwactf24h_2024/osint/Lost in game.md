### Details

Description:
```
I was reminiscing about the lockdown period, and during that time, I got hooked on a game, playing it day and night. The excitement and buzz around the game were unmatched, making it a standout gaming experience. After three years, I decided to go back to the game, only to realize I forgot my account ID. Trying to recover it, I asked a friend, who used to game with me, for help. Instead of giving me the info directly, he sent an audio file saying, "Here's your ID!" Now I'm stuck and can't find the ID. I love gaming, and so do my friends, but my friend turned this into an unexpected gaming challenge. Can you help me in finding my game account?

PS : We have a dedicated version for our nation.
