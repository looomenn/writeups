Apparently, you can use https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools/tree/master/Extractor to make it faster

Solved it using GitHub desktop (past commits are better visible there)

In branch No. 3 you can find the first part of the flag

![](assets/flag-1.png)

```
string[0] = G
string[1] = 1 
string[2] = t
...
string[9] = _
string[10] = 2
string[11] = 7
string[12] = 2
string[13] = 7
```

Another past was in the deleted screenshot in master branch

Finally, the last part was in `index.html` ( Branch No. 2)

![](assets/flag-3.png)

So, we ended up with 

```
string[0] = G
string[1] = 1 
string[2] = t
string[3: 6] = G1g
string[6:9] = ger
string[9] = _
string[10] = 2
string[11] = 7
string[12] = 2
string[13] = 7
```

Collect it together in one string and get the flag
