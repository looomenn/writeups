### TL;DR

The name of the one suspecious .exe file contained a link that led to a pastbin with the flag

There was nothing interesting in the image information. So we used `windows.cmdline` to see some proccesses

```bash
vol.py -f MEMORY.DMP windows.cmdline
```

With this, I found some suspicious file. The name of which looks like generated by virus to stay in the system. 

As you can see it's located in `temp` folder. Let's dump it

```bash
vol.py -f MEMORY.DMP filescan | grep \temp\
```


Dumping that file

```bash
$ vol.py -f MEMORY.DMP -o ./output windows.dumpfiles --physaddr 0x7e2ff070
```

Firstly, I though that it should be reversed, but just decoding it's name from base64 
```

we get a link to pastbin - pastebin.com/yAa1aKiu with the flag
