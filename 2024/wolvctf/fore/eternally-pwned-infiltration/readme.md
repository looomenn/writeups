*I'm writing this writeup more than 2 months after the completion of the CTF. There are no original screenshots, so I'll take it from the official [WU](https://github.com/WolvSec/WolvCTF-2024-Challenges-Public/blob/master/forens/eternally-pwned/Infiltration/solution/solve.md).* 


Notice something is up with the SMB traffic, possibly by indicators of compromise

You can see some base64 strings in the payload. So we need to find the flag in echo request and Trans2 Secondary Request, both part of MS17-10 payload (Â MS17-10 EternalBlue attack )

All strings combined: 


```

M3RlUm40bEx5X2cwXw==

YkxVM183bjl3bTRpV25MfQ==
```

gives as the flag
